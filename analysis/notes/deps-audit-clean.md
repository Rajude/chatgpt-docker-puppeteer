Chore: isolated dependency audit fix (clean base)

This branch is a clean, minimal record of an `npm audit fix --package-lock-only` run.
No lockfile changes were required compared to `main` at the time of the run.

This PR is intentionally LOW PRIORITY and should not be turned into a recurring reminder. Dependency-upgrade policy and deferral rationale are tracked in issue #20.

If maintainers wish to proceed with breaking upgrades, do so in focused PRs with compatibility testing.
